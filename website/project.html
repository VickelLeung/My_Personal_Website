							 <div class="projectDescription">
							A my first android application made with Android Studio. There are two game modes: player vs player and player vs computer. The basic AI prevents the player from winning which results in the best case being a draw if the player play first. I was able to learn a lot about how to use activities and the program in general. I have encoutered many problem but I was able to learn a lot from my mistake. One of the main problem was how to synchronize turns and tell who won the game. I was able to solve this problem by using a turn counter and also having a boolean variable to check if either players has won.
