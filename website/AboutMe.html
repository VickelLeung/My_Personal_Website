						<h2>Who am I?</h2>
						<p>
							My path as a web & android developer was not a walk in the park. There were many obstacles in my ways from financial issues to my father having stroke. Nonetheless, it is because of that I was able to become who I am today. I used to be an average student in high school and video game had a huge impact during my school year. However, that is a story for another time. 
							<br ><br >After high school, I decided to do something productive, which is getting a diploma in languages at Dawson college, but it was during my last year when I took an elective in computer science that I fell in love with programming. Soon after my graduation, I've applied to an university and major in computer science. Now here I am trying to change the world one step at a time with technology.	
						</p>
						<p>
							All that being said, my work ethic has changed and I have been working really hard to learn as much as possible to accomplish my dream of changing the world with my superpower(coding). However, it's not true that I am all work and no play. I like to start my day by going to the gym to release all the stress and worries out of my mind (healthy body = healthy mind). Nonetheless, I enjoy exploring new things and I am not scare of trying out anything outside my confort zone. I once went skydiving which I thought was lame, but it actually turn out ot be fun. I want to try everything in this world at least once because we only have one life and might as well make the most out of it.
