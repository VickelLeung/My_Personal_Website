A personal website that I made to display and organize all my works. 
The website has 3 pages; 
<br >
1-Projects: I discuses and show all my projects that have been done or that are currently work in progress. <br >
2-About me: A special page that talks more about me and a good way to get to know me. <br > 
3-Teaching materials: A page that has resources for all teaching materials that I use for mentoring students. <br >
<br >
The website was built using html, css, javascript and php.
